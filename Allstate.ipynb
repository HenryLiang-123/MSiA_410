However, because insurance is regulated at the state level, to roll out this new technology to every state would be very expensive, complicated and time consuming. It must be thoroughly tested in order to make sure the full roll-out is worth the all-in investment."

    "- There is some merit to his method of evaluation. Although it was not possible to conduct a truly randomized experiment by randomly assigning control and treatment, he made sure that factors of the control group such as seasonal sales volume and growth rates where as similar as possible to the treatment group. However, it is worth noting that other factors should be made as similar as possible as well. The case says that the sales process (ads, product enhancements, etc) was the forth or fifth most important factor. Ideally, the factors that could influence the outcome of the test should be as similar as possible.\n",
